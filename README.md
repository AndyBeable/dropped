# About Dropped
Based on a ficitious cycling company, Dropped is a elegant blog site covering all things cycling.

# Why Dropped?
This project was a chance for me to devleop my HTML & CSS skills. Specifically, I wanted to develop my SASS skills, as well as being a chance to try some of the features of Bootstrap v4.
The project itself combines a mix of flexbox, grid as well other layout features and is fully responsive.

# Features
- Implementation of AOS library, to give a light-weight, but visually appealing effect as the content loads.
